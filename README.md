# What is the Harmony Social Network

Semantic Harmony Social Network is a social network, based on the users interests that exploits a P2P Network. The system collects the profiles of the users, and automatically creates friendships according to a matching startegy. The users can see its friends over the time and are automatically informed when a user enter in the social network and became a new potential friend. The system defines a set of questions, At this point the system can computes the user scoring according the answers. This scoring is elaborated by a matching strategy that automatically find out the friends. The system allows the users to see the social network questions, create a profile score according the answer, join in the network using a nickname and eventually see all user friends.
